										<li>We suggest you fill those one last time at your local pharmacy as we do not want you to go without medication.</li>
										<li>We want to start working on your account right away, so your Pharmacist will proceed with transferring the rest of your medications to PillPack. Please call us once you have picked up a supply of ______________. That number is 855-745-5725</li>

										<li>By now you’ve received an email welcoming you to PillPack. In this email you will find a “Create My Password Now” button. We need you to click this button to verify that you’re receiving your emails from PillPack and to set up your secure password. Do you have time to do that now?</li>

						<p>By signing up with PillPack you agree to waive the child resistant safety cap requirement for all new prescriptions and refills. PillPacks are not child safe and should be kept out of the reach of children at all times.</p>
						<p>Last thing we need you to do is call your doctor’s office and tell them to change your preferred pharmacy to PillPack and authorizing us to manage your refills.</p>
						<p>If we have any questions during the process myself or someone from the Pharmacy Team will contact you. If you have any questions for us, please do not hesitate to contact us through the information listed on the email.</p>
						<p>Before I let you go, who else do you know would benefit from having their medications pre-sorted and delivered to them? (Remember: We need verbal consent for caregiver signups and we cannot call anybody that we do not have permission to call. Have them call us.)</p>
