	                        <p>Hi, is this <strong>@Customer.first_name@</strong>? Hi, <strong>@Customer.first_name@</strong> this is <strong>@Agent.full_name@</strong> calling from PillPack Pharmacy on a recorded line.</p>
							<p>I’m calling to help you better manage your medications. You signed up for PillPack a while back, to have all your medications pre-sorted and delivered directly to you. I’m calling to finish your account and send you your first PillPack right away! I just need to pull up your account and verify your information.</p>
							<p>Can you verify you last name and birthdate for me?</p>
							<p>Thank you.</p>
							<p>It looks like your account had an issue with <strong>@customer.Lead@</strong>.</p>
                    
							<p>(Once the on hold reason is resolved, continue with verifying the rest of their information)</p>
