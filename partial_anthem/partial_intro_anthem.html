	                        <p>The reason I ask is because PillPack is a new kind of pharmacy specifically designed for people who take multiple prescription medications. What separates us from all other pharmacies is that our pharmacists synchronize your medications and ship them to you in customized dose packets, at no additional cost to you. You’ll never have to sort your pills again, and you’ll always get the right medication at the right time.</p>

							<p>We also can send along most other items you would purchase at your local pharmacy. And this is another great thing about our service, we can save you time and trips to the pharmacy.</p>
