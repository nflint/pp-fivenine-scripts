    <p>Diabetes Inbound Script</p>
    <p><br>Thank you for calling PillPack. This is&nbsp;[advisor name] on a recorded line. How can I help you? <br>(Partner transfer)<br>Hi, [customer name]. Again my name is&nbsp;[advisor name], I am an advisor with PillPack Pharmacy and I will be helping you simplify the way you manage your health.</p>
    <p>I understand that you currently take 5 or more medications, is that correct? And do you have diabetes? Ok. Thank you.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>If YES to 5 or more meds - we can offer them a $25 coupon for any OTCs</li>
        <li>If NO to diabetes - skip diabetes section of the script</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The reason I ask is that PillPack is specifically designed for people who take multiple prescription medications. What separates us from all other pharmacies is that our pharmacists synchronize your medications and ship them to you in customized dose packets, at no additional cost to you.</p>
    
    <p>To start customizing your PillPack, all we need to do is collect some basic information from you. </p>
    
    <p>First, can I have you verify your email for me? Thanks</p>
    <p>Which insurance provider covers your medications? (Verify and collect insurance info)</p>
    <p>And the address we will be shipping to is ___________________, is that correct?</p>
    
    <p>(Verify information in partial and collect new info when necessary)</p>
    
    <p>As I said before, there is no additional cost for our service, the only thing you still need to cover are your copays, if you have any. </p>
    <p>What debit or credit card do you want on your account?</p>
    
    <p>Next, I need to collect your medication list and which pharmacies you currently use, so your PillPack pharmacist can transfer over your prescriptions and schedule your first PillPack.</p>
    
    <p>Diabetes Section</p>
    
    <p>Let&rsquo;s start with your diabetes medications, do you currently use insulin?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If yes - What&rsquo;s the name of it? </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>And do you use the vial or the pen?</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>If vial - Do you have a prescription for insulin syringes to inject it?</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>If yes- great, which pharmacy should we transfer that from?</li>
        <li>If no- we can contact your doctor for a prescription so that we can send the syringes to you with your insulin. Would you like us to do that for you? &nbsp;(You can also tell them that they are usually covered by insurance if they are hesitant)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>If yes- &nbsp;collect the doctor&rsquo;s name and contact number and ask if they have a preference of needle size that we should request. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>(If pen- they should have an rx for this- add this to the med list and confirm where it is filled)</li>
        <li>Do you fill your insulin at XXX pharmacy as well? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do you test your blood sugar? How many times a day do you test?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If yes- what kind of meter and test strips do you use?</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Which pharmacy can we transfer this prescription from?</li>
        <li>Do you have a prescription for lancets at XXX pharmacy also? (ask if they have a preference of needle size that we should request). </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>If yes- add lancets to the med list</li>
        <li>If no- offer to obtain prescription and collect MD info</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>(If they use insulin and/or test their blood sugar then ask): Do you have a prescription for alcohol swabs at your current pharmacy?</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>If yes- add it to the med list</li>
        <li>If no- ask: &ldquo;Would you like us to send you alcohol swabs in your shipments so you have everything you need in one place?&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>If yes- add it to the med list</li>
        <li>(We will try and bill it to their insurance, whether or not the insurance will cover it and what the copay would be is up to their insurance company.) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do you take any oral medications for your diabetes?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>(Obtain medication list including strength and how many times per day, dose times if they have a preference, and pharmacy to transfer those prescriptions from)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The reason that we&rsquo;re such a great fit for people with diabetes is we recognize that a lot of people living with diabetes have additional conditions that they manage, for example high blood pressure or high cholesterol. This &nbsp;amounts to a lot of additional time and stress managing all their medications. We will sort and manage your medications so you can focus on staying healthy.</p>
    
    
    <p>End of Diabetes Section</p>
    
    <p>You mentioned earlier that you take 5 or more medications. Let&rsquo;s go ahead and add these to your PillPack as well.</p>
    
    <p>What other conditions are you managing? </p>
    
    <p>Now let&rsquo;s collect the rest of your medications that you take so that your dedicated PillPack pharmacist can transfer those from your pharmacy and start building your all-inclusive PillPack.</p>
    
    <p>(Finish collecting meds and verify that all signup fields are completed)</p>
    
    <p>MANDATORY RECAP</p>
    
    <p>This needs to be read word for word. </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>So, here&rsquo;s what will happen now:</li>
        <li>Your pharmacy team will transfer your prescriptions over to PillPack Pharmacy and get any necessary refills.</li>
        <li>That process usually takes about 2 weeks, depending on how quickly we can get this information from your pharmacy(s) and doctor(s). </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>(Only read this section if current refills have not been discussed already)</p>
    <ul>
