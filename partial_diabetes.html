    <p>Let's start with your diabetes medications, do you currently use insulin?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If yes - What's the name of it? </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>And do you use the vial or the pen?</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>If vial - Do you have a prescription for insulin syringes to inject it?</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>If yes- great, which pharmacy should we transfer that from?</li>
        <li>If no- we can contact your doctor for a prescription so that we can send the syringes to you with your insulin. Would you like us to do that for you? (You can also tell them that they are usually covered by insurance if they are hesitant)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>If yes- collect the doctor's name and contact number and ask if they have a preference of needle size that we should request. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>(If pen- they should have an rx for this- add this to the med list and confirm where it is filled)</li>
        <li>Do you fill your insulin at XXX pharmacy as well? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do you test your blood sugar? How many times a day do you test?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If yes- what kind of meter and test strips do you use?</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Which pharmacy can we transfer this prescription from?</li>
        <li>Do you have a prescription for lancets at XXX pharmacy also? (ask if they have a preference of needle size that we should request). </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>If yes- add lancets to the med list</li>
        <li>If no- offer to obtain prescription and collect MD info</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>(If they use insulin and/or test their blood sugar then ask): Do you have a prescription for alcohol swabs at your current pharmacy?</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>If yes- add it to the med list</li>
        <li>If no- ask: &ldquo;Would you like us to send you alcohol swabs in your shipments so you have everything you need in one place?&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>If yes- add it to the med list</li>
        <li>(We will try and bill it to their insurance, whether or not the insurance will cover it and what the copay would be is up to their insurance company.) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do you take any oral medications for your diabetes?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>(Obtain medication list including strength and how many times per day, dose times if they have a preference, and pharmacy to transfer those prescriptions from)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The reason that we're such a great fit for people with diabetes is we recognize that a lot of people living with diabetes have additional conditions that they manage, for example high blood pressure or high cholesterol. This amounts to a lot of additional time and stress managing all their medications. We will sort and manage your medications so you can focus on staying healthy.</p>
